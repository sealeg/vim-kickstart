# About
Provides syntax highlighting for RedHat Linux kickstart configuration files.

The syntax rules are based around the most recent fedora documentation (f23).
There will likely be some gaps or options still in use by older versions that
are not accounted for. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request
if you spot any.

# Installation
